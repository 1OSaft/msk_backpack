FiveM Script - Usable Backpack Item

**Forum:** https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-esx-usable-backpack-item/4805469

## Description
* You can use the `bag` Item, then you get `nobag` Item and a Bag will be added to your Ped.
* If you use `nobag` Item then then the Bag will be removed from your Ped an you get the `bag` Item.

This Script works very well with the `Backpack Plugin` from `Chezza Inventory`

## Config
```lua
Config = {}
Config.Locale = 'de'

Config.VersionChecker = false
```

## Requirements
* ESX 1.2 (https://github.com/esx-framework/es_extended/releases/tag/v1-final)
* Chezza Inventory (https://chezza.tebex.io/package/4770357)

Should work with ESX Legacy too but I didn't test it.

### Plugin Download 
*(for Chezza Inventory)*

Insert `Config.Bags = {82}` in the `config.lua` from chezza inventory
